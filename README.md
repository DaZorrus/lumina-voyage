## Overview

Lumina Voyage is an atmospheric 3D space game where players control a luminous orb exploring zero-gravity environments. The game features an echolocation pulse system for environmental discovery, procedural audio that builds with progression, and chapter-based gameplay with distinct mechanics. Built with vanilla Three.js using a modular architecture.

### Design Patterns

**Entity System**: Base classes for game objects with lifecycle methods (update, destroy)

**System Architecture**: Decoupled systems for physics, audio, camera, particles

**Chapter Pattern**: BaseChapter provides common functionality, child classes implement specific gameplay

**Event-Driven Input**: InputManager centralizes keyboard/mouse handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DaZorrus/lumina-voyage.git
cd lumina-voyage

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Development server runs at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build

```bash
npm run build    # Production build to dist/
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| W/S | Move forward/backward |
| A/D | Move left/right |
| Q/E | Move down/up |
| F | Echolocation pulse/Slingshot |
| Mouse | Camera Distance |
| H | Key Controls Hint |
| ESC | Pause menu |

## Gameplay

### Chapter 0: The Void
Tutorial level teaching core mechanics. Collect 5 energy orbs to spawn portal and complete chapter. Each orb collected increases speed and unlocks audio layer. Pulse mechanic reveals hidden orbs.

### Chapter 1: The Ascent
High-speed obstacle course with 3x3 grid movement system. Collect photons to increase speed toward light speed threshold. Avoid meteors, black holes, and shadow comets. Reach 100% speed to trigger final portal sequence.

### Progression System
- Collectibles increase player speed incrementally
- Audio layers unlock progressively (pad, bass, harmony, melody, rhythm)
- Camera FOV adjusts dynamically based on speed
- LocalStorage saves chapter completion and settings

## Game Systems

### Physics
Cannon-es provides rigid body physics with trigger detection. High linear/angular damping creates arcade-style zero-gravity movement.

### Audio
Tone.js generates procedural music. Base ambient pad plays continuously. Five additional layers activate based on gameplay events. Each chapter uses different musical scales.

### Camera
Third-person follow camera with smooth lerp. FOV dynamically adjusts from 50 to 75 degrees. Screen shake effect at high speeds.

### Post-Processing
EffectComposer with RenderPass and UnrealBloomPass. Bloom strength adjusts based on gameplay intensity.

## Configuration

Settings stored in LocalStorage:
- Master volume
- Music volume
- SFX volume
- Chapter unlock state
- Orb collection progress

## Development

Project uses ES6 modules. Vite handles bundling and hot module replacement. Three.js examples imported from `three/examples/jsm/`.
